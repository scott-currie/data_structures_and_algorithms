# Fizz Buzz Tree
## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

## Approach & Efficiency
The fizz_buzz_tree function relies on two helpers, one to perform in-order traversal over the tree and one to inspect and modify the node values. An if/else gate determines the new value of node, if any.

Time: O(n) due to always having to visit every node.
Storage: O(1)
